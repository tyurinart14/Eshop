        The lightest and thinnest laptop manufactured by Apple MacBook Air 13 M1 256Gb 2020.
        It has been completely transformed, it has become even more powerful,
        thanks to increased endurance and CPU performance.
        Now its speed is 3.5 times faster, and machine learning has increased by as much as 9 times.
        Without charging, the MacBook functions longer than its predecessors.
        And even under heavy loads, it does not make unnecessary noise, because there is no fan in its design.
        Notebook Apple MacBook Air 13 M1 256Gb 2020 â€“ power has never been so compact and thin!</h2>
